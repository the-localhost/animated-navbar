# Animated Navbar
I've implemented a cool animated navigation bar, which can be directly used in sites like portfolios, etc.

This makes our site look much more modern, and UI improves a lot.

**ENJOY** my project [here](https://the-localhost.github.io/animated-navbar/).

Feel free to *fork/clone* and add it to your project!
